 It uses styled components(macro) which offers better readability of classes in debugging.

 The project uses the Node environment the npm run build depends on node modules and the source code provide has already ran

 So In this source code already contains a build/static folder which contain the Javascript and CSS files.

 ### How to start

1. Download or pull the repo to local machine and open it in the code editor of choice.

2. Ensure to also start the junior-react-endpoint server on another port:4000 

### Serving the Static Server 

Before serving,you must ensure to change directory (-cd) into the react-entry-test-scandiweb directory.

Then to serve do the following:

1. npm install -g serve.This installs the server globally on your local machine.

 #NB :There is no need to run this command where the user has a static server installed globally on their pc.


 2.serve -s build

The run serve -s build ensures that the project starts out of the box.
